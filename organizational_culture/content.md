Culture

- Speaking about this officially for the first time.
    - Have spoken and discussed about this with multiple organisations; examples of which will be covered.
    - But it was in bits and pieces. I will be connecting the dots, and hopefully I will be able to.

So, let's get started?

### Polls

- What comes to your mind when I say culture?
- What is it usually paired up with?
    - Indian culture, coding culture, literature, dating culture, tech culture, organization culture
- I will be speaking about organizational culture. 
    - Which is the parent to all the cultures we were speaking about.

#### Why should you listen to me?

- Because I have worked in and for organisations; striving for a good culture.
- And I have failed in the ones I was leading.
- I have been able to observe and identify differences in culture — 
    - when I was a part of GDSC TSEC, TSEC CodeCell
    - when I speak to my brother about ICICI, or my father about departments in RBI
    - during my time at JPMC
- When my final year started, I was thinking about a plan of action about what to do, and there might have been a hundred things, but one thing that I want to do is explicitly (not implicitly) improve the coding culture of my college (charity begins at home).
- Officially, I am a part of CodeCell and Entrepreneurship Cell of our college; and working towards organizational culture of these committees.
- But how do I do that? By giving "gyaan", yes. 
- But if we zoom out, it is less talking, more listening.
    - The way to do is to understand people, understand perspective, understand why certain decisions are being taken;
    - And there onwards potentially try to find flaws in the system or tweak their thought process.
    - TODO: A picture about dealing with things. A tree of decisions, nothing is right or wrong, it is about doing things the right way — morally and ethically.

So, this is not a checklist about:
- How to improve culture?
- How to work towards better culture?
- How to deal with toxic culture?

These are the answers you will find for yourself. 

This is going to be my take on culture. And trust me I am not "experienced", I will be just showcasing my naive experiences, thoughts and opinions about culture. This is just an attempt to make you aware. To help us think about culture when next time we look at an organisation.  

- Defining Culture
- We all think we are open-minded, until we come across a different culture, a different opinion, a different perspective. 

- tech/non-tech
- working/organising events
- CodeCell, GDSC TSEC, ICICI, JPMC, RBI

Types of Culture:
- Coding Culture
    - In terms of colleges 
- Tech Culture
    - In terms of firms
    - Engineering blogs (cult.fit)
    - Supporting open-source (Razorpay)
- Organizational Culture
    - DevFolio
        - A tight knit family with culture
        - Working towards a single goal
- Collaboration/Competition driven culture
- Result/Fear/Incentive driven
    - Carrot and the stick story
        - College Committees
        - Tech Firms like Amazon
        - Non. Tech firms like ICICI Bank 
        - Placement talk

Harsh
- hackathon spirit blog
- open conversations
- hearing and respecting opinions 
- how to be empathetic and practice empathy
- smallest case: empathy starts from within
- think thrice, not twice — before you say something

Or do anything or text or email. 
When I say this, I am not asking to hold back — I am asking to review your answer/response/way of receiving and sending it from all angles. It gives a good practice of empathy. 
And of course, something that is reviewed thrice is better than twice. 
It might save you from some trouble, someday.
