Culture

- Speaking about this officially for the first time.
    - Have spoken and discussed about this with multiple organisations; examples of which will be covered.
    - But it was in bits and pieces. I will be connecting the dots, and hopefully I will be able to.

So, let's get started?

#### Polls

- What comes to your mind when I say culture?
- What is it usually paired up with?
    - Indian culture, coding culture, literature, dating culture, tech culture, organization culture
- I will be speaking about organizational culture. 
    - Which is the parent to all the cultures we were speaking about.

#### Why should you listen to me?

- Because I have worked in and for organisations; asynchronously striving for a good culture.
- And I have failed in the ones I was leading. 
- But maybe that's why I am standing here.
- I have been able to observe and identify differences in culture — 
    - when I was a part of GDSC TSEC, TSEC CodeCell
    - when I speak to my brother about ICICI, or my father about departments in RBI
    - during my time at JPMC
- When my final year started, I was thinking about a plan of action about what to do, and there might have been a hundred things, but one thing that I want to do is explicitly (not implicitly) improve the coding culture of my college (charity begins at home).
- "Officially", I am a part of CodeCell and Entrepreneurship Cell of our college; but I am trying to work towards organizational culture of these committees.

##### How do I try to influence culture?

- By giving "gyaan", yes.
- This is a very broad question. You cannot just speak about culture - when you want to change culture.
    - You start asking questions about their interactions or just giving feedback on their decisions. 
- But if we zoom out, it is less talking, more listening.
    - The way to do is to understand people, understand perspectives, understand why certain decisions are being taken;
    - And there onwards potentially try to find flaws in the system or tweak their thought process.
    - TODO: A picture about dealing with things. A tree of decisions, nothing is right or wrong, it is about doing things the right way — morally and ethically.

#### What will we cover today?

So, this is not going to be a checklist.
- like most of the things I speak about: design, documentation, culture.

These are the answers you will find for yourself. 
- My job is to help you question things and how certain things can be looked at?

This is just going to be my take on culture. 
- And trust me I am not "experienced", I will be just showcasing my naive experiences, thoughts and opinions about culture. 
- To help us think about culture when next time we look at an organisation.

### Defining Culture

- 
- We all think we are open-minded, until we come across a different culture, a different opinion, a different perspective. 

Culture
- tech/non-tech
- working/organising events
- CodeCell, GDSC TSEC, ICICI, JPMC, RBI

Types of Culture:
- Coding Culture
    - In terms of colleges 
- Tech Culture
    - In terms of firms
    - Engineering blogs (cult.fit)
    - Supporting open-source (Razorpay)
- Goal-oriented Culture
    - DevFolio
        - A tight knit family with culture
        - Working towards a single goal
- Collaboration/Competition driven culture
- Result/Fear/Incentive driven
    - Carrot and the stick story
        - College Committees
        - Tech Firms like Amazon
        - Non. Tech firms like ICICI Bank 
        - Placement talk

Harsh
- hackathon spirit blog
- open conversations
- hearing and respecting opinions 
- how to be empathetic and practice empathy
- smallest case: empathy starts from within
- think thrice, not twice — before you say something

Or do anything or text or email. 
When I say this, I am not asking to hold back — I am asking to review your answer/response/way of receiving and sending it from all angles. It gives a good practice of empathy. 
And of course, something that is reviewed thrice is better than twice. 
It might save you from some trouble, someday.
