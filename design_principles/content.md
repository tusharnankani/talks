  - The three click rule.
    - Eg: WhatsApp Display Picture
    - Reducing clicks for 'payments'
  - "Successful UI design is about removing as many obstacles, bottlenecks, and potential confusion as possible from the user experience."

- Provide Clear Signposts
  - Navigating your app should not be intimidating or confusing. Instead it should be fun and fearless, and should take place unconsciously.
  - Simple, logical, clearly signposted
  - Visual cues wherever possible
  - The more the user is aware about its surroundings, the more comfortable user gets
    - Horizontal Progress for Scroll Bars
    - Form Progress
  - Clear Call to Actions (CTAs)
    - Eg: Samosa UI
      - Association of CTAs to color and icons.
  - Another Observation: Network Tab in Devtools
    - Close Icon on the Reosurces Tab is on the left 

- Be tolerant of mistakes
  - Mistakes happen. 
  - And users change their minds. 
  - In fact, if they are new to the app, they may not have been entirely sure of their actions in the first place.    
  - Make it easy to backtrack whenever necessary. 
  - Not only will this help to avoid the frustration of lost data and wasted time;
  - but it gives users the confidence to explore your app and make changes without fear of negative consequences.

  - Sending Email Acknowledgement
  - Copy to Clipboard vs. `Ctrl C`
  - Instagram's Save Posts

- Design the UI for Accessibility
  - Don’t assume that all users are just like you and the people you know. 
  - Social and cultural backgrounds
  - While realistically you can’t be expected to account for every possible variation in social and cultural convention;
  - Don’t automatically assume that the way you do things is the only logical way of doing them.
    - In many parts of the world people read from right to left.
  - Design with questions in mind, not answers. 
  - Try to question every decision, for a clearer understanding.
    - Even very simple things such as the colors you use will be viewed differently by different people. 
    - And this isn’t just a case of subjective or cultural differences either; 
    - A significant portion of the world’s population is color blind, after all. 
  - EG: Saathi
    - Surface area
      - Eg: Instagram's Double Tap
        - LinkedIn's same feature.   

- The best UI typeface goes unnoticed.
  - Simple UI design principles can help create a more effective user interface;
  -  facilitating interaction to such a degree that the user barely notices the UI at all.
