Note: Questions you might (not) get the answers to, but you will gain enough clarity get those answers yourself.

- Is competitive programming necessary? How to balance college, programming and other aspects?
- Does language matter? What language to start with? How to approach learning a new language?
- Is development really necessary or we can directly start with competitive programming? What should be my first preference (development or competitive programming)?

# Event Flow

Side note: Shoutout to [tsecgeeks.in](https://tsecgeeks.in/Dive-Into-CP) for documenting [Dive into Code](https://tsecgeeks.in/Dive-Into-CP), my first talk around this topic.

## Educating oneself about the difference

- Polls
    - What are we here to do today?
    - How many of you have solved at least on CP/DSA problem?
    - How many of you have built at least one project using any language?

- Disclaimer
    - !(speaker to audience session)
    - A conversation between peers. Feel to answer others' question if you want to.
    - About asking questions.

- What is DSA?
    - Data structures: A Data Structure is a way to organize data to allow processing of a large amount of data in a relatively short period of time.
    - Algorithm: Algorithms are well-defined sets of instructions designed that are used to solve problems or perform a task.
    - What does a **DSA problem** look like?
        - You are given a set of instructions. 
        - You have to figure out to solve the problem using a specific Data Structure and Algorithm.

- What is competitive programming?
    - Poll: What platforms do you know?
    - CP is a mind sport just like any other sport.
    - There are variables like time, speed and accuracy involved.

- DSA vs CP
    - What to do and thinking what to do
    - Quick vs Efficient
    - code quality
    - LL, BST are never used in CP
    - Answer to this is very goal specific actually but I try to put my opinion.
    - CP: It helps you build a problem solving mindset, improves code reading ability, debugging faster, optimising. (which is essentially what some companies are looking for in interviews.)

- Why competitive programming?
    - with developing Problem Solving skills.
    - to be a quick thinker.
    - to think about efficency in terms of time and memory limits.
    - And also, it is a part of recruitment/shortlisting for some companies for full time job roles.

- How do I start?
    - Level 1: Learn a language > Learn Standard lib(inbuilt) > Hackerrank
    - Level 2: Solve problems
    - Level 3: Participate in contests > Practice > Upsolve

- Anatomy of a CP Problem

## Strategies

- Solving strategy
    - Reading the problem and understanding the problem.
    - Filter the noise and make observations as you read.
    - Connect the dots and do something which you do know
    - Constraints.
    - Don't jump to the code. Think first.
    - Counter intutiveness about the think twice, code once.
    - Don't always optimize. If nothing works, try Brute Force.
    - Edge Cases.
    - Eg: Write a program to add 2 numbers.
- Contest strategy
    - Don't look at the leaderboard.
    - Probably look at the number of submissions.
    - Move to the next problem if you have given sufficient time to a problem.
        - Come back at it with a fresh perspective.
- Upsolving strategy
    - What is Upsolving?
    - Do n + 1 th problem from a contest.
    - Read others' code. 
        - Clean code?
        - Better implementation?
            - Eg: Reversing a bit. 
- Editorial reading strategy
    - Don't jump to the climax.
        - Don't look at the code directly.
        - Go step by step, line by line.
        - Try it after each line.
        - Even if you look at the code, do not copy paste. 
            - Write the code yourself.
        - Let it go if it doesn't make sense today.  
            - Don't take things too personally. It might make sense tomorrow.

## Mistakes I made

- Not getting out of my comfort zone.
- Moving to look at others' solutions quickly.
- Not being consistent.
- Giving up.

### Generalizations

- If we take a broader look, and zoom out a little from this scenario â€” it emulates real time problem solving.
    - Reading the problem and understanding it.
    - Understanding the requirements.
    - Thinking about an approach. (Design)
    - Thinking about efficency. (Feasability)
    - Coding out the problem. (Development)
    - Result of the problem. (Speed, Time, Testing)

## Real Time Examples

- Harsh Kapadia's Git Graph
- React's Diffing Algorithm
- React's Source code: Internal packages

## Some prestigious contests

- Codechef Snackdown
- [ICPC](https://icpc.global) (Internation Collegiate Programming Contest)
    - Team competition which happens annually across the world, that consists of several rounds.
    - Team of 3
    - Regionals (3-4 in india)
    - Asia finals
    - World finals
- [Google Kickstart, Hashcode and CodeJam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com)
- [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup)
- Codechef Snackdown

## How much time to spend on solving a problem?

## From where to practice?

Platforms:
- Hackerrank
- Codeforces
- Codechef
- AtCoder's
- Leetcode

For beginners:
- [AtCoder's](https://atcoder.jp), ABC every Saturday 5 PM IST
- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com), STARTER every Wednesday 8 PM IST
- [Codeforces](https://www.codeforces.com), Div 3

### How to start practicing?

- Implementation, constructive algo, Ad Hoc and greedy

## How to stay consistent

- Start enjoying the work, if you tell yourself consciously after sometime subconsciously you will start enjoying it.
- Make a peer group if 2-3 people who have same goal.
    - Hold each other accountable, and keep each others motivated.
- Have short discussions after contest.
- If practice gets boring then start learning any new DS/Algo.
- Have a growth mindset, and take responsibility for yourself.
