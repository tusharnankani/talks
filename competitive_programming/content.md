Note: Questions you might not get the answers to, but you will gain enough clarity get those answers yourself.

- Is competitive programming necessary? How to balance college, programming and other aspects?
- Does language matter? What language to start with? How to approach learning a new language?
- Is development really necessary or we can directly start with competitive programming? What should be my first preference (development or competitive programming)?

# Event Flow

Side note: Shoutout to [tsecgeeks.in](https://tsecgeeks.in/Dive-Into-CP) for documenting [Dive into Code](https://tsecgeeks.in/Dive-Into-CP), my first talk around this topic.

## Educating oneself about the difference

- What is DSA?
    - Something

- What is competitive programming?
    - CP is a mind sport just like any other sport.

- DSA vs CP
    - What to do and thinking what to do
    - Quick vs Efficient
    - code quality
    - LL, BST are never used in CP
    - Answer to this is very goal specific actually but I try to put my opinion.
    - It helps you build a problem solving mindset, improves code reading ability, debugging faster, optimising. (which is essentially what some companies are looking for in interviews.)

- Why competitive programming?
    - with developing Problem Solving skills.
    - to be a quick thinker.
    - to think about efficency in terms of time and memory limits.
    - And also, it is a part of recruitment/shortlisting for some companies for full time job roles.

- If we take a broader look, and zoom out a little from this scenario â€” it emulates real time problem solving.
    - Reading the problem and understanding it.
    - Understanding the requirements.
    - Thinking about an approach. (Design)
    - Thinking about efficency. (Feasability)
    - Coding out the problem. (Development)
    - Result of the problem. (Speed, Time, Testing)

- How do I start?
    - Level 1: Learn a language > Learn Standard lib(inbuilt) > Hackerrank
    - Level 2: Solve problems
    - Level 3: Participate in contests > Practice > Upsolve

## Strategies

- Solving strategy
- Contest strategy
- Upsolving strategy
- Editorial reading strategy

## Mistakes I made

- Not getting out of my comfort zone.
- Moving to look at others' solutions quickly.
- Not being consistent.

## How to think and solve a problem

- Read PS properly
- Constraints
- Try to do some observations
- Connect the dots and do something which you do know
- Then suddenly the solution will strike
- Move to code only if you have intuition or any small math proof

## Some prestigious contests

- ICPC
    - team competition which happens annually across the world, that consists of several rounds.
    - Team of 3
    - Regionals (3-4 in india)
    - Asia finals
    - World finals
- Google Competitions
    - Kickstart
    - Codejam
    - Hashcode
- Facebook Hackercup
- Codechef snackdown

## How to stay consistent

- Start enjoying the work, if you tell yourself consciously after sometime subconsciously you will start enjoying it.
- Make a peer group if 2-3 people who have same goal.
    - Hold each other accountable, and keep each others motivated.
- Have short discussions after contest.
- If practice gets boring then start learning any new DS/Algo.
- Have a growth mindset, and take responsibility for yourself.

- How much time to spend on solving a problem?

- From where to practice?
    - CF/CC/AC

- How to start practicing?
    - Implementation, constructive algo, Ad Hoc and greedy

## Contests

- For beginners 
    - Div 3 of CF
    - ABC of AC 

- For everyone
    - CF + CC + ABC
